# Spring Stuff

## Spring Rest
- Because we included the REST dependency - The REST Mappings, GET, POST, PUT, DELETE are automatically implemented with no code :tada:
- Just use camelCase and append 's' to the end
  - EG) - /tourPackages
  - EG) - /tours

- It also have a /search endpoint for each endpoint - It lists all the search methods available
  - EG) /tourPackages/search/findByName?name=Backpack%20Cal
